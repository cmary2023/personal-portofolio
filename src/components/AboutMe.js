       <h3>Hey there, üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h3>
         Welcome to my personal portofolio. I'm <span> Maria </span>, a graduate with a <span>Bachelor Degree</span> in <span>Engineering in Computers and Information Technology</span> from Romania.<br></br> I started my coding journey in October 2022 and I'm loving it! I enjoy the bliss of solving problems and being able to create things with programming. <br></br> I'm a fast and enthusiastic learner, and I'm very excited to work on the next and more interesting projects.
          To develop my skills I used self-teaching resources such as the awesome <span>FreeCodeCamp.org </span>and <span>Udemy's "The Complete Web Developer in 2023 :Zero to Mastery "</span> course by Andrei Neagoie.
          <br></br>
          Often working on some kind of personal project both for the enjoyment of the process as well as a way to apply the theoretical knowledge gained.<br></br>
          I aspire to be an Front-End Web Developer and later an Full Stack Web Developer.<br></br>
